# Generate Subtitles for Videos using Whisper from OpenAI (100% local on MacOS)

## Introduction

Subtitles play a crucial role in making videos accessible to a global audience. Whether you're sharing a tutorial, a lecture, or entertainment content, providing subtitles in multiple languages can significantly enhance your video's reach. But manually creating subtitles in different languages is a time-consuming task.
For me, I used it for generating subtitles for my favourite films.

This is where **Whisper by OpenAI** comes inâ€”a powerful tool that leverages cutting-edge AI to generate accurate subtitles in various languages, helping you automate and streamline this process.
